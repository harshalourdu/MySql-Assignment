# 1.
|Feature	|SQL Databases	|NoSQL Databases|
|-----------|---------------|---------------|

|Full form  |Structured Query Language (SQL)|Not Only SQL (NoSQL)|

|Data Structure|Tables with rows and columns (relational)|Varies (key-value, document, column-family, graph)|

|Schema|Fixed, predefined schema	|Schema-less or flexible schema|

|Scalability|	Vertical scaling (adding more power to a single server)	|Horizontal scaling (adding more servers)|

CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT
);


DROP: Used to delete a database object like a table, database, or index. Example:

sql

DROP TABLE students;

ALTER: Used to modify an existing database object, such as adding or removing columns or changing data types. Example:

sql

ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR(100);

TRUNCATE: Used to delete all rows from a table, but keeps the structure intact. It is faster than DELETE and cannot be rolled back in most databases. Example:

sql

TRUNCATE TABLE students;


# 3.

INSERT: Used to add new rows of data into a table. Example:

sql

INSERT INTO students (student_id, name, age) VALUES (1, 'Alice', 22);


UPDATE: Used to modify existing data in a table. Example:

sql

UPDATE students SET age = 23 WHERE student_id = 1;


DELETE: Used to remove rows from a table. Example:

sql

DELETE FROM students WHERE student_id = 1;



# 4.

DQL (Data Query Language) refers to SQL commands used to query data from a database. The main operation in DQL is the SELECT command, which retrieves data based on specified conditions.

SELECT: Retrieves data from one or more tables. Example:
sql

SELECT name, age FROM students WHERE age > 20;



# 5.

Primary Key: A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a database table. It ensures that each record is uniquely identifiable and prevents duplication. A primary key field cannot contain NULL values.

Example:

sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT
);




# 6. 

import mysql.connector

# Establish connection to MySQL
db = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="root",
    password="password",
    database="test_db"
)

# Create a cursor object
cursor = db.cursor()

# Example of executing a query
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM students")

# Fetch all results
results = cursor.fetchall()

# Print results
for row in results:
    print(row)

# Close the cursor and connection
cursor.close()
db.close()


# 7.

The general order of execution for SQL clauses is:

FROM: Specifies the tables to retrieve data from.

JOIN: Specifies how tables should be joined together.

WHERE: Filters records based on a specified condition.

GROUP BY: Groups the records into summary rows based on a specified column.

HAVING: Filters the grouped records based on a condition.

SELECT: Specifies which columns or expressions to retrieve.

DISTINCT: Removes duplicate records from the result set.

ORDER BY: Sorts the results based on one or more columns.

LIMIT: Limits the number of rows returned by the query.

SELECT name, age 
FROM students 
WHERE age > 20 
GROUP BY age 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 
ORDER BY age DESC 
LIMIT 5;


In this query:

The FROM clause specifies the table (students).
The WHERE clause filters records where age > 20.
The GROUP BY clause groups the records by age.
The HAVING clause filters groups that have more than one student.
The SELECT clause defines the columns to display (name, age).
The ORDER BY clause sorts the result by age in descending order.
The LIMIT clause limits the result to 5 rows.
